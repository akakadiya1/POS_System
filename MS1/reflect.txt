Reflection:

- I completed this milestone alone, with the assistance of my professor's code, and by reading the course materials.

- I wrote program of creating POS system by declaring functions, Switch case and variables. I declared functions prototype in PosUI.h like menu, returnSel, and runPos. I wrote all these functions in PosUI.c file and Used it in main.c file. I reused my utils sources in this program to flush and get foolproof integer entry for selection.

- I wrote a C program that simulates a point of sale (POS) system for a store. It consists of several functions, including a menu function that displays a list of options for the user to choose from, and a returnSel function that executes the user's selected option. The available options include viewing the store's inventory, adding items to the inventory, removing items from the inventory, updating the stock of an item, and processing a sale at the POS. The program also includes functions for loading and saving item data to and from a file. The main function runs the program by loading the item data, displaying the menu options, and executing the user's selected option until the user chooses to exit the program, at which point the item data is saved and a goodbye message is displayed.

- If I am describing the steps of this milestone in descriptive way then it should be written as below:

* 1. The program starts by calling the runPos function with a filename parameter. This function is responsible for loading the item data from the file, displaying the menu options to the user, and executing the user's selected option.

* 2. The runPos function begins by calling the loadItems function to load the item data from the file into the program.

* 3. Next, a while loop is entered that will continue running until the user chooses to exit the program. The returnSel function is called within this loop, which displays the menu options to the user and executes the user's selected option.

* 4. The returnSel function also enters a while loop, which continues until the user selects an option that causes the function to exit. For exiting program, I used flag variable and done it to 1 while user enters 0 and it exits the program. Within this loop, a switch statement is used to determine which option the user has selected, and the appropriate function is called to execute that option.

* 5. If the user selects option 1, the inventory function is called, which displays the message "Inventory" to user.

* 6. If the user selects option 2, the addItem function is called, which displays the message "Adding Item" to user.

* 7. If the user selects option 3, the removeItem function is called, which displays the message "Remove Item" to user.

* 8. If the user selects option 4, the stockItem function is called, which displays the message "Stock Items" to user.

* 9. If the user selects option 5, the POS function is called, which displays the message "Point Of Sale" to user.

* 10. If the user selects option 0, the returnSel function exits and returns the value 0 to the runPos function, which causes the while loop to exit.

* 11. Once the while loop in the runPos function exits, the program calls the saveItems function to save the updated item data back to the file.

* 12. Finally, a "Goodbye!" message is displayed to the user, and the program terminates.

- I did not face any issue to complete this milestone because I researched on concepts of workshop's logic and gain knowledge about it by using professor's note. After doing everything, I organized this source code into functions and when I compiled and built it, It runs as I want. Thank You so much for giving us this kind of program, because of this I expand my knowledge about C language so far.
