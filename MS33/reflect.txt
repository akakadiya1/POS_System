Reflection:

- I completed this workshop alone, with the assistance of my professor's code, and by reading the course materials.

- I wrote program of creating POS System by declaring arrays and cStrings, designing structures and accessing text files to read information. I declared functions prototype in PosApp.h like display, billDisplay, cost, getItems, start, inventory, addItem, removeItem, stockItem, POS, listItems, loadItems and saveItems. I wrote all these functions in PosApp.c file and Used it in main.c file by calling it.

- I learned how to design and create structures in C Program in Multiple Files and what is the difference between creating it in One File and Multiple Files. I learned to use and pass Array of structures from one function to another by using pointer concept which is very exciting and new for me. I accessed text files to read information so I learned opening and closing of file. I learned to format and display structure information on screen.


- If I am describing the display function in descriptive way then it should be written as below:

* 1. The function display takes a pointer to a struct Item as its parameter and is used to print the contents of the item in a specific format.

* 2. The function Prints a line of equal signs to indicate the beginning of the item display, Prints the name of the item, followed by a new line.

* 3. Then Prints the SKU of the item, followed by a new line, Prints the price of the item with 2 decimal places, followed by a new line.

* 4. After that, It prints the cost of the item (price + tax) if the item is taxed, or "N/A" if the item is not taxed. Following that, Prints the quantity of the item in stock, followed by a new line and another line of equal signs to indicate the end of the item display.

- I didn't face any issue to complete this workshop as I knew concept of this already. After that, I wrote code by applying professor's method and succeded in it. By doing all these things, I learned so many concepts. For that, A big Thanks to you Fardad.
