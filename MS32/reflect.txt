Reflection:

- I completed this workshop alone, with the assistance of my professor's code, and by reading the course materials.

- I wrote program of creating POS System by declaring arrays and cStrings, designing structures and accessing text files to read information. I declared functions prototype in PosApp.h like billDisplay, cost, getItems, start, inventory, addItem, removeItem, stockItem, POS, listItems, loadItems and saveItems. I wrote all these functions in PosApp.c file and Used it in main.c file by calling it.

- I learned how to design and create structures in C Program in Multiple Files and what is the difference between creating it in One File and Multiple Files. I learned to use and pass Array of structures from one function to another by using pointer concept which is very exciting and new for me. I accessed text files to read information so I learned opening and closing of file. I learned to format and display structure information on screen.


- If I am describing the saveItems function in descriptive way then it should be written as below:

* 1. The function takes a pointer to a struct Item as its parameter and returns a double value.

* 2. The function creates a character array tempString with a size of 14 + 1 (for the null terminator).

* 3. The first 14 characters of the item's name are copied to tempString using strncpy() function. The null terminator is added to the end of tempString.

* 4. The function prints the formatted string to the standard output. The first argument is the format string, which specifies how the output should be formatted. %14s tells printf() to output a string with a field width of 14, left justified. %10.2lf tells printf() to output a double with a field width of 10 and two digits after the decimal point, right justified. The last argument is the value to be printed for the item's tax status. If the item is taxed, "Yes" will be printed; otherwise, three spaces will be printed. The function returns the cost of the item.

- I didn't face any issue to complete this workshop as I knew concept of this already. After that, I wrote code by applying professor's method and succeded in it. By doing all these things, I learned so many concepts. For that, A big Thanks to you Fardad.
